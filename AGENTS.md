# AGENTS.md — narada.usc

This repository defines the reusable substrate for Universal Systems Constructor work.

## Working Posture

Use Progressive De-Arbitrarization before implementation. Do not answer or implement a presenting request if hidden decision-relevant arbitrariness remains.

Preserve these distinctions:

- principal intent vs inferred policy
- semantic closure vs execution
- task creation vs task claiming
- evidence vs assertion
- review finding vs integration decision
- residual blocker vs informal commentary

## Filesystem Rules

- Do not create derivative status files such as `*-EXECUTED.md`, `*-RESULT.md`, or `*-DONE.md`.
- Update the canonical artifact directly when work is complete.
- If review finds residual work, create or update a normal task file.
- Keep private operational traces out of this public repository.

## Public Boundary

This repo may contain reusable protocols, schemas, examples, and sanitized session patterns.

This repo must not contain:

- private repo names unless intentionally public
- credentials, tokens, customer data, private mailbox content, or internal operational traces
- app-specific implementation decisions that belong in `narada.usc.<app-name>`

## Verification

This repo is documentation/protocol first. Prefer targeted checks:

- inspect Markdown links when changing docs
- validate JSON schemas when changing schemas
- do not run broad unrelated test suites
